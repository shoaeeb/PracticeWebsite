      <h1>What Makes My Web Design Services Different?</h1>
      <p>I teach this stuff..</p>

      <div class="about-me">
        <h3>I teach developers how to develop.</h3>
        <p>
          My name is Miles Sebesta. I was born and raised in Visalia California
          where I attended Golden West High School.
        </p>
        <p>After Golden West I went on to graduate from UC Davis.</p>
        <p>
          Post college, I worked in Sacramento as a lead developer and online
          marketer before moving back to the Central Valley.
        </p>
        <p>
          I currently work for Geekwise Academy and Bitwise Industries as a
          developer instructor and business consultant.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am dedicated to bringing the latest and greatest website design to
          my hometown Visalia, California because I want to see technology
          change this great valley.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am dedicated to teaching the next generation of developers and
          marketers so that the solutions are community needs are created at
          home by our neighbors.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="title-page">
        <h3>
          I titled this page “Web Design Visalia” because this really matters to
          me.
        </h3>
        <p>
          When I say “Website Design Visalia” I mean it! You get local code,
          made by local people.
        </p>
        <p>
          I won’t outsource your code to China or India. I believe it is
          important to keep business local and support the local San Joaquin
          Valley economy, and individuals that are looking to better our
          community, not take from it!
        </p>
        <p>
          When you work with me you are getting a website design that was
          designed, and coded by a local developer.
        </p>
        <p>
          You are also getting great customer support that is paired with your
          “Website Design Visalia” service.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="fact">
        <h3>Straight Forward Fact; Custom Costs</h3>
        <h4>A custom web site costs twice as much as a template.</h4>
        <p>For a custom brochure website expect to pay $6,000+</p>
        <p>For a custom eCommerce store look to pay $10,000+</p>
        <p>
          By custom design, I mean custom wireframes, mock-ups, and code /
          functionality.
        </p>
        <p>
          Meaning anyone ever mentions the word “template” then your prices
          should be HALF of what I mentioned above! If you are paying “custom
          web design” prices for a template you are getting ripped off!
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="technologies">
        <h3>What web technologies do I use?</h3>
        <p>
          For basic eCommerce or simple websites you get an easy to maintain and
          update web site through an online content management system like
          WordPress or Magento. Custom web applications depend completely on
          their performance tasks at hand thus either LAMP, MEAN, or MEVN stacks
          will be used depending on project requirements.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="quick">
        <h3>Expect a quick turn around</h3>
        <p>
          The date of completion depends upon the scope of work and time needed
          to complete a the project. I like to create a great dialogue with you
          to provide a web site marketed and created directly towards your
          needs. Please, be weary of any designer that claims they can provide
          you with a custom website designed in a few weeks. I have been in the
          website design industry for years and to be frank, it usually takes
          longer than that for a custom site. The site is probably based upon a
          template rather than a “custom design”, or corners might be cut. Those
          who claim such timely turn-a-rounds might have code that leaves your
          website vulnerable to spam and hackers. Regardless, these unrealistic
          dreams will leave a nasty taste in your mouth and hole in your pocket
          book. I work very direct, give you a fair estimate, and work to make
          the design perfect to your needs.

      <div class="ask">
        <h3>
          Finally, ask your developer to explain 301 redirects in an easy way!
        </h3>
        <p>
          I believe you should work with people who have the heart of a teacher.
          Ask your developer about Title Tags, and 301 redirects, if they can’t
          explain them in a way you understand then find a new developer!
